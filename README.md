# STM32F4XX Microcontroller Projects
## Overview
This repository contains a collection of projects implemented using the STM32F4XX microcontroller. The projects demonstrate the integration of various peripherals, such as LCD displays, LEDs, and UART communication. The code is written in C and is organized into separate files for each peripheral.

## Hardware Requirements
1. STM32F4XX Microcontroller
2. MX-Link V2 Debugger
3. Breadboard
4. Connecting Wires
5. USB to TTL Converter (for UART projects)
5. LCD Interface (for LCD Display projects)
6. LEDs (for LED Display projects)
   
## Software Requirements
1. Keil uVision 5
2. STM32 Microcontroller License
3. Tera Term (for UART projects)

## Project Structure
The repository is organized into files corresponding to different peripherals:

lcddisplay.c

This project involves the integration of an LCD display with the microcontroller. The LCD interface is connected via a breadboard.
ledinterface.c 

This project demonstrates the use of LEDs connected to the microcontroller via a breadboard.
led_toggle.c 

This project basic use of toggling LEDs connected to the microcontroller via a breadboard.
uart

The UART project requires additional hardware, including a USB to TTL converter. It involves console log output using software like Tera Term, allowing monitoring of transmitted and received bytes.
template.txt

This file contains sample code for generic LED and LCD displays. It serves as a reusable template for other projects.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

         git clone https://github.com/MasumiPatel/STM32F4XX.git

Open the project folder using Keil uVision 5.

2. Connect the STM32F4XX microcontroller to the MX-Link V2 debugger and set up the hardware according to the project requirements.

3. Add the code to the main.c file in generated project of keil uvision 5 .

4. Build and flash the project to the microcontroller.

5. Monitor the output using Tera Term or other appropriate tools for UART projects.
